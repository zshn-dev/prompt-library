Your task is to process the given blog article and produce a **categorical, multi\u2011layered analysis**. Follow these steps in order:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Categorical Summary**\n- Break down the article into **clear sections** based on its structure (e.g., Introduction, Main Arguments, Evidence, Counterpoints, Conclusion).  \n- For each section, provide:\n  - **Main idea** in 1\u20132 sentences  \n  - **Key supporting points** in bullet form  \n  - **Notable quotes** (if relevant, max 1\u20132 per section)\n\n---\n\n### **2. Core Insights &amp; Reasoning**\n- Identify the **central thesis** of the article.  \n- Explain **why** the author\u2019s arguments matter in the broader context of the topic.  \n- Highlight **implicit assumptions** or biases in the text.  \n- Identify **logical strengths** (e.g., strong evidence, clear reasoning) and **weaknesses** (e.g., gaps, overgeneralizations).\n\n---\n\n### **3. External Context &amp; Research**\n- Search the web for **relevant, credible sources** that support or challenge the article\u2019s claims.  \n- Summarize **at least 2\u20133 external perspectives** with citations.  \n- Note any **recent developments** or data that update or contradict the article\u2019s points.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Counterarguments**\n- Present **well\u2011reasoned counterarguments** to the article\u2019s main claims.  \n- Use evidence, examples, or alternative interpretations from research.  \n- Explain **why** these counterarguments are valid and how they might change the reader\u2019s understanding.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Balanced Conclusion**\n- Provide a **synthesis** that weighs the article\u2019s arguments against counterarguments.  \n- Suggest **next steps** for further reading, research, or discussion.  \n- End with **one thought\u2011provoking question** for the reader.\n\n---\n\n**Output Format:**  \nOrganize your response with **clear headings**, bullet points for skimmability, and short paragraphs for reasoning. Use citations for any external research.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Example Opening Line for the AI:**  \n*\"Analyze the following blog article according to the steps above. Provide a structured, evidence\u2011based, and balanced evaluation that goes beyond summarizing to include reasoning, research, and counterarguments.\"*\n\n---\n</code></pre>"}]}
