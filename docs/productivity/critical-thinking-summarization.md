- For each section, provide:
  - **Main idea** in 1â€“2 sentences  
  - **Key supporting points** in bullet form  
  - **Notable quotes** (if relevant, max 1â€“2 per section)

---

### **2. Core Insights & Reasoning**
- Identify the **central thesis** of the article.  
- Explain **why** the authorâ€™s arguments matter in the broader context of the topic.  
- Highlight **implicit assumptions** or biases in the text.  
- Identify **logical strengths** (e.g., strong evidence, clear reasoning) and **weaknesses** (e.g., gaps, overgeneralizations).

### **3. External Context & Research**
- Search the web for **relevant, credible sources** that support or challenge the articleâ€™s claims.  
- Summarize **at least 2â€“3 external perspectives** with citations.

### **4. Counterarguments**
- Present **wellâ€‘reasoned counterarguments** to the articleâ€™s main claims.  
- Use evidence, examples, or alternative interpretations from research.  
- Explain **why** these counterarguments are valid and how they might change the readerâ€™s understanding.

---

### **5. Balanced Conclusion**
- Provide a **synthesis** that weighs the articleâ€™s arguments against counterarguments.  
- Suggest **next steps** for further reading, research, or discussion.  
- End with **one thoughtâ€‘provoking question** for the reader.
